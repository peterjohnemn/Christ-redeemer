                <h2>How and Why It Was Built</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    The statue was built to symbolize peace, faith, and the deep Christian devotion of the
                    Brazilian
                    people.
                    The idea for the monument was first proposed in the 1850s, but it was revived in the early
                    20th
                    century to
                    commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brazil’s independence. Construction began in 1922 and
                    was
                    completed in 1931
                    after nine years of work. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and sculpted
                    by
                    French artist Paul
                    Landowski, the statue was constructed using reinforced concrete and covered with thousands
                    of
                    soapstone tiles for
                    durability and elegance. Standing <strong>30 meters (98 feet) tall</strong>, with its
                    <strong>arms
                        stretching 28 meters
                        (92 feet) wide</strong>, and resting on an <strong>8-meter (26-foot) pedestal</strong>,
                    Christ
                    the Redeemer towers
                    majestically atop Corcovado Mountain.
